<h3>Is it safe to link my Corppass account(s) to my Singpass app? How can I be sure that my corporate data on the Singpass app is not easily accessible to others?</h3>
<p>User authentication with your biometrics (fingerprint or face) or a 6-digit
passcode is required to link Corppass accounts on the Singpass app. You
are also required to verify your identity before viewing any corporate
data on your business profile. A 2-minute grace period is provided, allowing
you to easily switch between one section or service to another, after which
user authentication will be required again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You are advised to secure your device and its contents with a strong password,
and only register your own fingerprint or facial biometrics for access
to the device. You should not share a screenshot or recording of your corporate
data with other individuals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you misplace your device, you can secure your account on the Singpass
website, or simply install the app on another device as soon as possible
to deactivate your app on your old device. &nbsp;</p>
