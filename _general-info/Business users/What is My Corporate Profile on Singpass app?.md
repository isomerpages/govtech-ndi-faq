<h3>What is the My Corporate Profile feature in the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>My Corporate Profile allows individuals authorised by businesses and other
entities, such as non-profit organisations and associations, to access
and view selected corporate data on the Singpass app. You need to have
an active Corppass account for a local UEN entity currently registered
with an Issuance Agency (e.g. ACRA) to be able to use this feature.</p>
