<h3>If I am assigned Corppass account(s) for other business entities after the initial setup, would I need to link the additional Corppass account(s) to my Singpass app?</h3>
<p>The one-time account setup seeks your consent to link existing and future
Corppass accounts. Subsequently, the app will retrieve and display the
latest list of Corppass account(s) that you are authorised to access every
time you tap on ‘Switch Account’. You are not required to manually link
Corppass account(s) assigned to you after the initial setup. This applies
to the removal of Corppass accounts assigned to you as well.</p>
