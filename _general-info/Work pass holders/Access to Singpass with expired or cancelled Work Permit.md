<h3>My Work Permit has expired/ I have cancelled my Work Permit. Can I still use Singpass to access services?</h3>
<p>Your Singpass account is valid for 3 months from your Work Permit expiry
or cancellation date. You can continue to access services with Singpass
during the 3-month grace period, but not your Myinfo data. After which,
your Singpass account will be deactivated.</p>
