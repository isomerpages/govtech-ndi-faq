<h3>I am a Donee appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). What are the documents I have to submit in order to set up multi-user SMS 2FA on behalf of the Donor?</h3>
<p>Donees are required to submit the following supporting documents:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) that appoints you to make decisions on
the Donors behalf&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical Report certifying the Donors lack of mental capacity. Please note
that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Medical Report must be issued by a certified medical practitioner
registered with the Singapore Medical Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Medical Report must clearly state the Doctor's opinion on the Donor's
mental capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Medical Report must be dated after the date of LPA registration.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Donor's loss of mental capacity is not permanent, the Medical Report
must be dated within the last 6 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may upload the supporting documents via the Multi-User SMS 2FA application
form for Donees here: [<a href="https://go.gov.sg/multi-user-donee" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://go.gov.sg/multi-user-donee</u></a>]</p>
<p>If there is more than one Donee appointed under the LPA and the LPA states
that the Donees are required to act 'jointly', each Donee will be required
to submit this form separately.</p>
