<h3>I have an IRAS Unique Account (IRAS-UA) account. I received an email to activate a Singpass Foreign user Account (SFA). What should I do?</h3>
<p>Please follow the instructions in the email to activate your SFA. After
activation, Singpass will link your IRAS-UA account to your SFA and you
will be able to access both IRAS-UA and the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-sfa-rplist" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>other digital services</u></a> with
your SFA.
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact the Singpass helpdesk at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-sfa-rplist" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>support@singpass.gov.sg</u></a> or
+65 6335 3533 if you have difficulties accessing IRAS digital services
after activating your SFA account.
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Ensure that the SFA created for you contains the same personal details
(Foreign ID and name) as your IRAS-UA to use the Singpass app as your login
method.</p>
