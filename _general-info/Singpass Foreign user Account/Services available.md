<h3>What services can a Singpass Foreign user Account access?</h3>
<p>A Singpass Foreign user Account (SFA) for Foreign ID users can only be
used to access digital services provided by the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-sfa-rplist" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>SFA organisations</u></a>.
<br>
<br>It is unlike the Singpass account for NRIC/FIN users, which can be used
to access government and selected private sector digital services in Singapore.</p>
