<h3>What should I do if my one-time password expires during my account activation?</h3>
<p>A one-time password can be triggered when you reset your password using
this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-sfa-resetpassword" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a>.

<br>Note: The one-time password is only valid for 15 minutes upon receipt.</p>
