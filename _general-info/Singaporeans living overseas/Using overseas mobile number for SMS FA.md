<h3>I am relocating overseas. Can I use my overseas mobile number for Singpass SMS FA?</h3>
<p>Only Singapore-registered mobile numbers can be used to register for SMS
2FA. If you are travelling or living overseas, please use the Singpass
app or Face Verification as 2FA instead to access government digital services.</p>
