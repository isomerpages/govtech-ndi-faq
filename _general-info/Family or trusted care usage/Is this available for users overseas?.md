<h3>Is this service available when either or both users are based overseas?</h3>
<p>This service is available as long as the mobile number is locally registered,
i.e., starts with +65. Users who are not able to visit Singpass counter
can present their NRIC/FIN to verify their identities and activate Multi-User
SMS 2FA over a video call with the Singpass Helpdesk.
<br>
<br>Please contact <a href="mailto:support@singpass.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>support@singpass.gov.sg</u></a> to
set up a video call.</p>
