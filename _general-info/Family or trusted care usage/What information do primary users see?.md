<h3>Once the Multi-User SMS 2FA is activated, does the primary user get to see all the secondary userâ€™s information?</h3>
<p>The only information that primary users of the mobile number will be able
to see is the SMS-OTP. This means that the primary user will not be privy
to the type of service that the secondary user is accessing.
<br>
<br>Secondary users will still receive direct communications from the Government
via mailers and not via the primary users mobile number.</p>
