<h3>I am a Deputy appointed under a Deputyship Court Order. What are the documents that I have to submit in order to set up Multi-User SMS FA on behalf of the person lacking mental capacity?</h3>
<p>Deputies are required to submit a copy of the Court Order as a supporting
document. You may upload the Court Order via the Multi-User SMS 2FA application
form for Deputies <a href="https://go.gov.sg/multi-user-deputy" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
<br>
<br>If there is more than one Deputy appointed under the Court Order and the
Court Order states that the Deputies are required to act 'jointly', each
Deputy is required to submit this form separately.</p>
