<h3>As a secondary user, how can I change my primary mobile number to someone else?</h3>
<p>You may visit any of the <a href="http://go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass counters</u></a> islandwide
with the new primary user or contact the Singpass Helpdesk at <a href="http://go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>support@singpass.gov.sg</u></a> to
schedule a video call if you have difficulty visiting a Singpass counter.
<br>
<br>The system will automatically override the mobile number with the new
number once the process is complete.</p>
