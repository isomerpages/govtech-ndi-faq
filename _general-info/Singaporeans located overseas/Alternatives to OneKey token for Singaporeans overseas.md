<h3>I reside overseas and the OneKey Token was my only 2FA method. What are my alternatives if I need to access digital services that require Singpass 2FA?</h3>
<p><strong>For seamless access to digital services, we highly encourage users to switch to the <a href="https://app.singpass.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass app</u></a>.</strong>
<br>
<br>To set up your Singpass app, you can request for a PIN mailer to be sent
to your mailing address registered with the Immigration and Checkpoints
Authority of Singapore (ICA). To do so:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Download Singpass app from the official app stores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch the app and log in with your Singpass ID and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the screen prompting for an OTP, scroll down and click on the hyperlink
in the sentence If you are not able to complete setting up Singpass app
with your existing 2FA, click here for alternative options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select 'Mail a PIN to my address'.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A PIN mailer will be sent to your registered mailing address within 10
working days (subject to overseas postal operations and delays). Follow
the instructions in the PIN mailer to complete the app setup.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, you can set up Singpass app using Face Verification (only
available on browsers of smart devices with camera).
<br>
<br><strong>If you do not have a smartphone, you may use Singpass Face Verification as your 2FA.</strong>
<br>For Face Verification, simply log in to any government digital service
with your Singpass ID and password. Select Face Verification at the next
step and follow the instructions on your screen to scan your face. This
service works on a computer that is equipped with a web camera or a mobile
device with a front-facing camera.
<br>
<br><strong>If you have a locally-registered mobile number (starting with +65), you may also register for SMS 2FA on <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-login" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass Portal</u></a></strong>
<br>To use SMS 2FA, simply log in with your Singpass ID and password, followed
by a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS to your mobile phone.</p>
