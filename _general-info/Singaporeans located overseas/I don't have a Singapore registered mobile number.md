<h3>I do not have a Singapore-registered mobile number. Can I set up SMS FA using an overseas mobile number?</h3>
<p>Only Singapore-registered mobile numbers can be used to register for SMS
2FA. If you are travelling or living overseas, please use Singpass app
or Face Verification instead as 2FA instead to access government digital
services.</p>
