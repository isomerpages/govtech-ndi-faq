<h3>If I have misplaced (or did not receive) my PIN mailer, what should I do?</h3>
<p>Request a new PIN mailer from Singpass:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-login" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass Portal</u></a>&nbsp;&gt;
Select 'Reset password' under Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new PIN mailer will then be sent to your registered overseas address
within 10 working days (depending on overseas postal services).</p>
</li>
</ol>
