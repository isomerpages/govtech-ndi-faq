<h3>What is the My Cards feature in the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>The My Cards feature allows users to conveniently access Government-issued
identity cards for personal and professional identification. As more Government-issued
identity cards become available in a digital format, they will be progressively
added to My Cards.
<br>
</p>
<p>Users can access the other cards by either swiping the cards under the
My Cards, or by tapping on the labels above the card to access the other
cards. Authentication is required to view the full details of your digital
cards.</p>
