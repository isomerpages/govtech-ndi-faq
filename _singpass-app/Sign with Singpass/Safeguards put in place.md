<h3>What are some safeguards put in place for digital signing?</h3>
<p>Sign adopts cybersecurity measures in line with industry best practices,
including a combination of encryption and multi-layered security. IT security
measures are also reviewed and updated on a regular basis to better safeguard
the digital signing process.</p>
<p>During the signing process, no document data will be transferred between
the digital signing partner / business partner's platform and the national
digital identity platform. Only a cryptographically random, unintelligible
and irreversible code representing the signed document will be transferred
during the transaction.</p>
