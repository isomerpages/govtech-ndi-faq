<h3>If my phone is compromised and hackers have access to my data, will they also get my Digital IC data?</h3>
<p>Singpass is built to ensure high levels of security, such as requiring
verification when accessing important information, like the Digital IC.
It is meant to withstand most types of security breaches&nbsp; when threats
are detected on the device, the app will lock itself and will not be usable
until the threat subsides.
<br>
<br>However, there may be rare cases where access may be compromised. It is
thus the onus of the individual to ensure secure access to their device
and the app (e.g., by not disclosing their PIN or setting up only their
own biometric profiles for access to their device) and ensure that threats
are minimised. The latter can be prevented by not jailbreaking, not accessing
or downloading suspicious materials and performing virus scans.
<br>
<br>If you suspect a potential breach, you are encouraged to lodge a police
report and contact the Singpass Helpdesk at <a href="tel:+6563353533" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">6335 3533</a> (press "9" for 24-hour scam support)
