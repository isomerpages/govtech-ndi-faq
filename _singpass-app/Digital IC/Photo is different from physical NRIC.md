<h3>Why is the photograph in my Singpass Digital IC different from my physical NRIC card?</h3>
<p>The Singpass Digital IC is a form of digital identification designed for
convenient identity verification on the go.
<br>
<br>To enable it to be used as an alternative to the physical NRIC, the Digital
IC is kept up-to-date by displaying the most recent information available.
This includes the latest photograph you have provided to the Immigration
&amp; Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA), e.g. when you renewed your
passport or re-registered your NRIC. The retrieval of the latest photograph
from ICAâ€™s records for display on the Singpass Digital IC applies to all
Singpass users.</p>
<p>The updated photograph in the app helps counter officers verify your identity
more accurately, improving overall security for users.</p>
