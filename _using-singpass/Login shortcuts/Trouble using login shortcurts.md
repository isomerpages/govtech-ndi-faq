<p>You may not have the required Internet browsers installed on your device.</p>
<p><strong>For Android devices</strong>

<p>Login Shortcuts are compatible only with the Chrome browser for security
reasons. Please install Chrome on your device and try again.</p>
<p><strong>For Huawei devices</strong>

<p><strong>For iOS devices</strong>

<p>The mobile Internet browser that launches when you access a service via
Login Shortcuts depends on your default mobile browser. For instance, if
you have set up Chrome as your default mobile browser, the digital services
will launch in the Chrome browser when you tap on the Login Shortcut. This
applies to any third-party browser apps, e.g. Firefox and Edge.</p>
