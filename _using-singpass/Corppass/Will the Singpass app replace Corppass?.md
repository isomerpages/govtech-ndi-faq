<h3>Will the Singpass app replace Corppass?</h3>
<p>The inclusion of corporate features on the Singpass app provides a more
convenient and secure access to pertinent corporate data on the go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corppass is currently the single authorisation system for businesses and
entities to manage their employeesâ€™ access to digital services to perform
corporate transactions with the Government. GovTech will progressively
roll out new features to improve and facilitate more secure and seamless
corporate transactions.</p>
