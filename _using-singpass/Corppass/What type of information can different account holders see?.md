<h3>Why are all types of Corppass account holders within my business/organisation able to view entity information on the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>The entity information on the Singpass app (via My Corporate Profile)
is consolidated from publicly available data from various Government sources
to enable business users more convenient and secure access to corporate
data. All Corppass account holders within the same business/organization
are individuals authorised by the business/organisation on the Corppass
portal to transact with the Government in a business capacity. Hence, they
will be able to view entity information on the Singpass app after completing
user authentication during the one-time business profile setup* on the
Singpass app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
