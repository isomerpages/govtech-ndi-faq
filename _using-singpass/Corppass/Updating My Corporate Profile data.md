<h3>How can I update the data in My Corporate Profile?</h3>
<p>My Corporate Profile consists of data retrieved from Government sources,
reflecting what has been registered and verified with the source Agency.&nbsp;
Please contact the relevant source Agency to update any necessary information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To update data related to entity profile, address, previous UENs &amp;
names, appointments, shareholders, capital and financial highlights, please
approach the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) via BizFile
at this <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/eServicesListing.jspx?transId=B-CHANGES" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To update data related to builders &amp; contractor information, please
approach the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) via eBACs. You may
click <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/eBACS/Document/eBACS_User_Guide.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> for
instructions to access eBACS.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the source Agency has verified your information and processed the
data update, it will take 1-3 working days for the information to be reflected
on your Singpass app.</p>
