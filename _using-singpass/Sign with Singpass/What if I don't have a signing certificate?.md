<h3>I do not have a signing certificate. Can I still digitally sign with Singpass?</h3>
<p>No. You will not be able to digitally sign a document if you have not
activated your signing certificate. When digitally signing a document with
your Singpass app for the first time, you will be prompted to complete
a one-time activation of your signing certificate. If you are facing any
technical issues, please contact Singpass Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@singpass.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>support@singpass.gov.sg</u></a> for
assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not need to sign any documents with your Singpass app, you do
not have to activate your signing certificate. You may continue to log
in to digital services with your Singpass app.</p>
