<h3>Is digital signing using Sign with Singpass secure?</h3>
<p>Using signing certificates issued by the National Certification Authority,
Assurity Trusted Solutions Pte. Ltd., Sign with Singpass produces digital
signatures that are regarded as Secure Electronic Signatures (SES) under
Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital signature is identifiable and cryptographically linked to
the signer, providing higher assurance of the authenticity and integrity
of the signed documents. This differs from electronic signatures generally,
which may require additional supporting evidence and audit trails to prove
their authenticity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The signed documents are also tamper-proof, such that if the electronic
record is altered, the system will alert the user that the signature is
invalid. Subsequent changes to the signed document are detectable and credentials
are uniquely linked and identifiable to the signers.&nbsp;</p>
