<h3>If I have signed a document successfully using Sign with Singpass, do I still need to sign that same document in hardcopy?</h3>
<p>It is not necessary to sign a document in hardcopy if you have successfully
signed with Singpass. If you are executing a contract, please take care
to ensure that your contract can be executed electronically.</p>
