<h3>For transactions with commercial entities, what data will be retrieved from my Singpass Myinfo Profile?</h3>
<p>Commercial entities can only request personal data that is required for
their forms and to process your transaction. Your consent will always be
sought before any personal data is retrieved.</p>
