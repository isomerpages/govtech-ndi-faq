<h3>How do I provide my information to businesses using the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>Let's say you are at a registration counter:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Launch your Singpass app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scan the Singpass QR code displayed at the counter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the data that needs to be shared and give your consent to proceed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify your identity using your fingerprint (for selected smartphones),
face (for selected smartphones) or 6-digit passcode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your data will be sent across securely, and you're done!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can currently use Singpass app at selected counters. More businesses
will be on board soon.</p>
