<h3>Why wasnâ€™t my financial information auto-fill on the digital service form, like the rest of my info?</h3>
<p>Upon Singpass authentication, forms will be auto-populated by pulling
your personal data, such as name, NRIC and address, across participating
government agencies. However, financial data such as yearly income and
CPF statements will always require your consent before any retrieval takes
place.</p>
