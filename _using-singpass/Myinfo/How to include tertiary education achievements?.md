<h3>How can I include my tertiary education achievements? (e.g. Diploma, Degree, Masters)</h3>
<p>The education data displayed in Singpass app profile currently covers
the National General Certificate of Education Ordinary “O”, Normal “N”
and Advanced “A” levels. We are still working to include higher level certification
details from local education institutions in the Singpass app profile.
This is likely to be effected in the coming years.</p>
