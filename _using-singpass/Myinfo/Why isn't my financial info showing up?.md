<h3>Why isnâ€™t my financial information showing up in my Singpass Myinfo Profile?</h3>
<p>Due to scheduled maintenance during low transaction periods, IRAS and
CPF information will be unavailable at the following times:</p>
<p><strong>CPFB: </strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every day 5:00 am to 5.30 am</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IRAS:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every Wed, 2:00 am to 6:00 am <em>(UTC +8 hours)</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every Sun, 2:00 am to 8:30 am <em>(UTC +8 hours)</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We seek your understanding as GovTech is working with CPFB and IRAS to
minimise the inconvenience.</p>
