<h3>I have deactivated my phoneâ€™s front-facing camera and would prefer not to turn it on for Singpass Face Verification. What are my alternatives when prompted for a face scan during app setup?</h3>
<p>After entering your Singpass ID and password, if your device does not
have a camera or the camera is disabled, you can request for a PIN to be
mailed to your mailing address registered with the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints
Authority (ICA) or Ministry of Manpower (MOM).</p>
<p>You may follow the instructions in the PIN mailer to complete the setup
of your Singpass app.</p>
