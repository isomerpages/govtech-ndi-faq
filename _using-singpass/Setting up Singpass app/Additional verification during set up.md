<h3>I was prompted to perform an additional verification during setup of my Singpass app. This was not required previously. Why is there a need for this additional step?</h3>
<p>Singpass is continuously updating its threat detection and login security
as part of our efforts to combat evolving scams. The setup process of the
Singpass app is critical as it ties the user’s identity to the app for
subsequent logins.</p>
<p>From 10 October 2022, users may be required to perform a face scan enabled
by Singpass Face Verification during app setup as an additional measure
to mitigate impersonation scams and prevent unauthorised access to users’
Singpass account.</p>
