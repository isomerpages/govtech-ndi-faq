<h3>Can I choose to skip/opt out of the additional security verification when setting up my Singpass app?</h3>
<p>You cannot skip or opt out of the additional security verification as
it is an additional measure to mitigate impersonation scams and prevent
unauthorised access to your Singpass account.</p>
