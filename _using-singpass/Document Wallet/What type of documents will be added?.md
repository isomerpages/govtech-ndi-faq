<h3>What type of documents will be added to my Document Wallet?</h3>
<p>For a start, users who intend to travel may visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotÎ±rise</u></a>&nbsp;to
obtain their HealthCerts directly within the Singpass app. Issuance of
a Vaccination HealthCert for a dependent (i.e. your vaccinated child) will
also be added here.</p>
<p>These HealthCerts include Vaccination certificates and Pre-Departure Test
(PDT) certificates. PDT certificates can refer to Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) tests, Antigen Rapid Tests (ART), or Serology tests administered
officially by a recognised medical facility.
<br>
<br>More document types will be added in the future.</p>
