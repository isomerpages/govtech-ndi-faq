<h3>What is the Document Wallet feature in the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>The Document Wallet provides a convenient way to view official documents
issued by participating Government agencies in one place. The Documents
category can be found alongside your other Profile categories on the apps
homepage.
<br>
<br>Documents are sorted by issuance date and will remain in the folder even
if you reinstall your app.</p>
