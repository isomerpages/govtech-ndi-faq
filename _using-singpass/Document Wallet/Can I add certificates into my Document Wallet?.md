<h3>Can I add certificates that I own into my Document Wallet?</h3>
<p>No, only official documents retrieved from participating Government agencies
will be displayed. Currently, users who intend to travel may visit the
<a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotÎ±rise</u> 
</a>to obtain their HealthCerts directly within the Singpass app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These HealthCerts include Vaccination certificates and Pre-Departure Test
(PDT) certificates. PDT certificates can refer to Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) tests, Antigen Rapid Tests (ART), or Serology tests administered
officially by a recognised medical facility.</p>
<p>We welcome feedback on additional use-cases which can be prioritised for
your convenience. Our team will take your feedback into consideration as
we continue to improve the app.</p>
