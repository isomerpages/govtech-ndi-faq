<h3>When will scanning the QR code on my Vaccination HealthCert be required?</h3>
<p>Your Vaccination HealthCert may be shown to immigration authorities as
part of the necessary documents required for travel. The certificate may
also be used for other purposes where official proof of your vaccination
status is requested.
<br>
<br>To safeguard personal data, users are reminded to practise good security
hygiene such as verifying the identity of officials before sharing their
details and refraining from sending screen captures of their HealthCerts
to others.</p>
