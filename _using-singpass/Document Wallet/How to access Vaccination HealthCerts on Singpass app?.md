<h3>How do I access my COVID-19 Vaccination HealthCerts on the Singpass app? How does it work?</h3>
<p>Your Vaccination HealthCerts will be sent to your Document Wallet in the
Singpass app when requested from <a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotÎ±rise</u></a>.
You will also receive a confirmation message in your Singpass app Inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To view your Vaccination HealthCerts, you may:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap on the button in the Inbox message; or&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the Documents profile category on the apps homepage</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>Authentication using your fingerprint, face or passcode is required to
view your HealthCerts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vaccination HealthCert can be used to digitally validate your vaccination
status by presenting the QR code to immigration authorities for scanning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For security reasons and protection of user data, each instance of a QR
code instance has a validity period of 14 days and is automatically refreshed
thereafter.</p>
