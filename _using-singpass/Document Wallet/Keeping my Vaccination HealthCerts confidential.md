<h3>How can I keep my Vaccination HealthCerts confidential?</h3>
<p>The Vaccination HealthCert serves as digital proof of your vaccination
status and may be requested by authorities when travelling. To safeguard
personal data, users are reminded to practise good security hygiene such
as verifying the identity of officials before sharing their details and
refraining from sending screen captures of their HealthCerts to others.</p>
