<h3>I am unable to use Singpass to get my Vaccination HealthCert. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Individuals not eligible for a Singpass account, or whose pass has expired,
may obtain their Vaccination HealthCert using their passport number and
dates of vaccination recorded in MOH databases. To do so, select the 'Login
via Passport Number' option via the&nbsp;<a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotÎ±rise</u></a>&nbsp;portal.</p>
<p>Please note that you may need to update your immunisation record by submitting
a request to retag your vaccination records to your current passport number
via this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/health-cert-query" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a>,
or confirm your vaccination status first by clicking <a href="https://go.gov.sg/vax-status-query" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p>Processing time for your query would be 2-4 weeks, and you will be receiving
your Vaccination HealthCert via email after a successful issuance.</p>
<p>Please contact&nbsp;<a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>support@notarise.gov.sg</u></a>&nbsp;if
you have further queries.</p>
