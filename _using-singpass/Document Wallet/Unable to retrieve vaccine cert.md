<h3>I have been vaccinated. Why cant I retrieve my Vaccination HealthCert yet?</h3>
<p>Your Vaccination HealthCert will only be available for retrieval if you
were vaccinated in Singapore and have received a vaccine which has been
approved for use in Singapore.
<br>
<br>If you have received an approved vaccine and are still unable to retrieve
your HealthCert, it may be due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You have not completed all doses of the vaccine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has been less than 14 days since you received the final dose of the
vaccine. Your HealthCert will only be issued when the interval from the
completion of Vaccine Course to Fully Vaccinated Validity is met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interval between your vaccine doses is outside of the recommended
minimal interval for the vaccine. Please refer to <a href="https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>MOH's vaccination site</u></a> for
more information on the recommended interval between doses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
