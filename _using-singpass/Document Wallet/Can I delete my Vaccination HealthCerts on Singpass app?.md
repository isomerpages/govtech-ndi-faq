<h3>Can I delete the Vaccination HealthCerts from my Document Wallet in the Singpass app?</h3>

information on your Vaccination HealthCert is outdated (e.g., new passport
number is issued after renewal of passport), you may request for the issuance
of an updated certificate on the&nbsp;<a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotÎ±rise</u></a>. A new Vaccination HealthCert
will be sent to your Document Wallet.</p>
