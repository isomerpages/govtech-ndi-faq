<h3>I have just set up my Singpass app and could access full details on my Digital IC without authenticating. Why is this so?</h3>
<p>We have made it easier for users to navigate the app during a transaction
by offering a 2-minute grace period upon authentication for users to switch
from one category/service to another before authenticating again.
<br>
<br>You have authenticated during the app setup and accessed the Digital IC
details within the 2-minute grace period. Please exit the app, wait for
2 minutes, and try accessing the Digital IC again. You will be prompted
to verify your identity before full details can be displayed.</p>
