<h3>What are exceptions where the Digital IC is not accepted? What services require physical identity cards to be presented?</h3>
<p>From 1 November 2021, Government agencies have accepted the Digital Identity
Card (IC) on the Singpass app as an alternative means to prove an individual's
identity for in-person agency services.
<br>
<br>However, there may be a small number of situations where the physical
identity card (e.g. NRIC or long-term pass card) is specifically required,
such as the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Hotel check-ins require physical IC based on National Registration Regulations.
This legislation is being reviewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code and/or the National Registration
Act require the physical IC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Registration Regulations require the physical IC for these
services from ICA: IC registration, re-registration, replacement, citizenship
completion of formalities, renunciation of citizenship or PR, revocation
or reinstatement of PR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exchange of a Photo ID is required as collateral for passes to enter
secured premises. There are ongoing efforts to progressively implement
electronic access control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the Digital IC is allowed by MOE and SEAB for identification at
national examinations, some educational institutions may have other policies
concerning the use of mobile phones on premises.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>Generally, we are striving to have the Digital IC accepted wherever a
form of personal identification is requested. Businesses are also encouraged
to accept the Digital IC, though we note that private organisations have
their separate operational considerations and may need time to accept and
onboard new verification methods.</p>
