<h3>I am unable to scan my Singpass Digital IC barcode at counters/kiosks. Why is this so?</h3>
<p>The Digital IC barcode has been enhanced to accommodate different device
bezels.
<br>
<br>Unsuccessful barcode scanning may also be due to the use of incompatible
barcode scanners, which at times are unable to read accurately due to light
interferences or anti-reflective coating/protectors.
<br>
<br>To increase the chances of successful scanning, you may like to try adjusting
the screen brightness or the phone's angle during scanning in the meantime.</p>
