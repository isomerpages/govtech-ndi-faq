<h3>How do I access the Digital IC?</h3>
<p>To view your Digital IC, all you need to do is:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Launch the Singpass app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the Digital IC card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify your identity using your fingerprint, face or 6-digit passcode.
Even after successful authentication, personal details that are normally
found in the physical IC are masked by default. Click on Show details to
view full details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>You can also tap on the eye icon to unmask the NRIC number/FIN and tap
on Show barcode to scan your NRIC/FIN barcode at kiosks, such as those
at libraries and SingHealth polyclinics.</p>
