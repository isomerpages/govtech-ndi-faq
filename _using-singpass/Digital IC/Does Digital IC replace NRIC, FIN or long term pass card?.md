<h3>Does the Digital IC replace my physical NRIC, FIN or long-term pass card?</h3>
<p>The Digital IC is a feature in your Singpass app that displays your name,
NRIC number/FIN, photo, and other details that are on your physical NRIC/long-term
pass card.
<br>
<br>You can choose to use the Digital IC in place of your physical NRIC/long-term
pass card, as most Government agencies accept its use. Businesses are also
encouraged to accept the Digital IC as an alternative to the physical NRIC
or long-term pass card for identity verification.
<br>
<br>You may be required to produce your physical NRIC/long-term pass card,
if required by law in some specific situations, or if the agency or business
requires it for specific transactions.&nbsp;For the list of government
agency services that may still require physical identification cards to
be presented, please refer to the FAQ "What are exceptions where the Digital
IC is not accepted? What services require physical identity cards to be
presented?".
<br>
<br>If you lose your physical NRIC/long-term pass card issued by the Ministry
of Manpower (MOM) / Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA), you
must report the loss and apply for a new card within 14 days for the NRIC
and 7 days for the long-term pass card.</p>
