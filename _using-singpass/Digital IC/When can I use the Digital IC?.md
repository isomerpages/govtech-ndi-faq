<h3>When can I use the Digital IC?</h3>
<p>You can use the Digital IC when a Government agency needs to verify your
identity by checking your identity credentials, such as name, NRIC number
and photograph (in compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act). For
example, you may present your Digital IC for counter services or tap on
Show barcode to scan your NRIC/FIN barcode at kiosks, such as those at
libraries and SingHealth polyclinics.
<br>
<br>There may be a small number of situations where the physical identity
card (e.g. NRIC or long-term pass card) is specifically required. Please
refer to the FAQ “What are exceptions where the Digital IC is not accepted?
What services require physical identity cards to be presented?” for more
details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses are also encouraged to accept the Digital IC as an alternative
to physical NRIC or long-term pass card for identity verification, though
we note that private organisations have their separate operational considerations
and may need time to accept and onboard new verification methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure security, you will need to verify yourself (using your fingerprint,
face or passcode) to access details on your Digital IC.</p>
