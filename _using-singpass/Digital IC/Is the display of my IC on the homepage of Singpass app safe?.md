<h3>The Singpass Digital IC is displayed on the homepage of my app. Is this safe? What happens if I lose my phone?</h3>
<p>The Digital IC on the Singpass app homepage displays minimal information
(e.g., partial NRIC number/FIN) that are masked by default to protect your
privacy. You are required to verify your identity using your fingerprint,
face or 6-digit passcode to view your full NRIC number/FIN and more details
on your Digital IC.
<br>
<br>You are also advised to password protect your device and set up only your
own biometric data for secure access. Should you misplace your device,
you may choose to deactivate the Singpass app quickly on the Singpass website
or install the app on another device to automatically deactivate it on
the lost device.</p>
