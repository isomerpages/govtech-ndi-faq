<p>The Digital IC is a feature in your Singpass app that displays your name,
NRIC number/FIN, photograph, date of birth, sex, nationality, date of issue,
registered address, pass type and status, pass issue and expiry date, and
other additional fields for work passes such as the employer and sector.</p>
<p>You can tap on the Digital IC card and verify your identity to display
more personal details, such as your date of birth, registered address,
etc. You can also tap on the eye icon to unmask the NRIC number/FIN and
tap on "Show barcode" to scan your NRIC/FIN barcode at kiosks, such as
those at libraries and SingHealth polyclinics.</p>
<p>There may be a small number of situations where the physical identity
card (e.g. NRIC or long-term pass card) is specifically required. Please
refer to the FAQ “What are exceptions where the Digital IC is not accepted?
What services require physical identity cards to be presented?” for more
details.</p>
<p>Businesses are also encouraged to accept the Digital IC, though we note
that private organisations have their separate operational considerations
and may need time to accept and onboard new verification methods.</p>
