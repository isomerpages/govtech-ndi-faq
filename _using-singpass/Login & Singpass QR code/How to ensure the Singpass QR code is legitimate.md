<h3>How do I ensure that I am scanning a legitimate Singpass QR code when accessing services?</h3>
<p>To ensure security, you should use only the Singpass app (and not other
QR code scanners) to scan the Singpass QR code when accessing services.
Singpass app has stringent security measures in place and will always check
for the QR codes' legitimacy and validity before you can proceed to complete
the authentication. You may see an error message on the Singpass app if
it is an invalid QR code, and you will not be able to proceed.
<br>
<br>When logging in to a service using Singpass app, you should also check
that the website URL stated on the confirmation page on the app matches
that in the web browser address bar.
<br>
<br>These best practices help to prevent phishing of personal information
through QR code spoofing.</p>
