<h3>What is the multi-language feature in Singpass?</h3>
<p>To ensure services are easily accessible, the Singpass app is available
in Singaporeâ€™s four official languages: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.
Users can switch to their preferred language in the app settings.</p>
<h3>Why are some parts of the Singpass app, e.g. messages in the inbox, not translated?</h3>
<p>The translations are rolled out progressively starting February 2022,
and will be extended to more features in a phased approach.</p>
<p>Messages sent to the Singpass app inbox will be in the same language used
by the government agency sending the notification. We will be working with
other government agencies to offer multilingual notifications for selected
messages in future.</p>
