<h3>I am an Employment Pass/Work Permit holder but my occupation is inaccurately reflected on my profile. How do I amend it?</h3>
<p>Your employer will need to inform the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of any
changes in your employment details via the iSubmit function <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/isubmit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
Please select request type 'Work Pass Application Matters (Excluding Work
Permit)' if you are an S Pass or Employment Pass holder when submitting
the document.</p>
<p>For work permit holder, your employer needs to fill in the '<a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/notify-mom-of-changes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Change Work Permit holder's occupation</u></a>'
form and submit it through request type 'Amendment of Information/Particulars
for Foreign Workers and Foreign Domestic Workers' <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/isubmit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p>Your profile will reflect the updated employment details after MOM has
approved the amendment.</p>
