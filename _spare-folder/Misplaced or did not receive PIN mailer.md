<h3>I have misplaced (or did not receive) my Singpass PIN mailer, what should I do?</h3>
<p>You can request for a new PIN mailer to be sent to you.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/home/ui/online-reset-password/user-detail" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click here</a> (reset
password page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter your 'NRIC or FIN number' and 'Date of issue'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new PIN mailer will then be sent to your registered address within 3
working days for a local address and 10 working days for an overseas address
(depending on the overseas postal services).</p>
