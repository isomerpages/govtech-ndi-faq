<h3>Why does the Singpass app not have a logout button?</h3>
<p>The Singpass app works as an authenticator and is only triggered when
you are accessing a service or your information. You will then be prompted
to verify yourself using your fingerprint (for selected smartphones), face
(for selected smartphones) or 6-digit passcode.</p>
