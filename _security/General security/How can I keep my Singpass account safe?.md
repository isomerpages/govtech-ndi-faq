<p>Here are some tips for you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Set up Singpass 2FA (e.g. SMS-OTP or Singpass app), which provides an
additional layer of security to better protect your personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never share your Singpass ID, password and 2FA details with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not re-use passwords. Certain websites that you access may not be secure.
Login information may be stolen from these sites and used to hack your
Singpass account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change your passwords regularly and use strong passwords. Strong passwords
are alphanumeric and contain 8 to 24 characters.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware of phishing websites that look like government websites to trick
you into disclosing your personal details. To verify that it is not a phishing
website, always check that the URL domain is correct (<strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/even-safer-singpass" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.singpass.gov.sg</a></strong>)
and that there is a ðŸ”’ 'lock' icon in the address bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When logging in to services with your Singpass app, check that the URL
domain displayed on the app's consent page matches that on the Internet
browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you have completed your transaction, log out of the service instead
of closing the browser window.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singpass does not send hyperlinks or QR codes through SMSes or WhatsApp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update your contact details registered with Singpass to receive security
and transactional alerts promptly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
