<h3>What should I do if I am accessing Singpass using a public computer?</h3>
<p>If you are logging in with Singpass on a public computer:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensure that the browser does not remember your password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not connect to unsecured Wi-Fi networks, as the information you provide
may be visible to other users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you have completed your transaction, log out of the service instead
of closing the browser window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
