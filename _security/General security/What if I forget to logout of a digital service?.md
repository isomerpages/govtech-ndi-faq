<h3>What happens when I forget to log out of a digital service after accessing it via Singpass app?</h3>
<p>If you forget to log out of a digital service from your Internet browser,
you will automatically be logged out of the digital service after a period
of inactivity.
<br>
<br>However, you are encouraged to always log out of the digital service directly
from the Internet browser once the transaction is completed.</p>
