<h3>When I launch the Singpass app I received a security alert and the app auto closed. What should I do?</h3>
<p>We have implemented stringent security measures in the app to better protect
your Singpass account and personal data.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If your phone has been rooted/jailbroken, please use another device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your phone contains apps that alter the phone settings (e.g. screen
capturing or fake GPS apps), please uninstall them before setting up Singpass
app.</p>
</li>

<p>If the above two scenarios do not apply to you, please contact the Singpass
