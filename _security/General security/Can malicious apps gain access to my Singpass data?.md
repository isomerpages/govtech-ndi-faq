<h3>Can malicious apps which may have unknowingly been installed on my phone gain access to my personal data displayed in Singpass app?</h3>
<p>Your personal data is safeguarded through encryption technology in the
Singpass app. Malicious apps would not have access to the data.
<br>
<br>As an added security measure, you will be prompted to quit the app immediately
if the app detects potential security breach or presence of malicious software
on your mobile device.</p>
