<h3>What if my facial features change due to personal reasons or unforeseen circumstances (e.g. cosmetic surgery, accident, etc.)?</h3>
<p>Individuals who no longer resemble their NRIC or passport photograph due
to medical reasons (e.g. surgery) can apply for a replacement of their
NRIC or passport with ICA. This ensures that the Governments biometric
database of facial images remains up-to-date.</p>
