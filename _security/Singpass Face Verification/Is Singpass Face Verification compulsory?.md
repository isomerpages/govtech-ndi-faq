<h3>Is it compulsory for me to use Singpass Face Verification?</h3>
<p>We may in certain situations require you to use Singpass Face Verification
where we deploy it as an additional means to guard against unauthorised
access to your account. You may be required to do this when you log in
to services on a new device or Internet browser, or for certain higher
risk transactions.
<br>
<br>Otherwise, if you do not wish to use Singpass Face Verification, you may
continue to log in or transact using other authentication methods. For
on-site assistance, you may visit any <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/html/go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass counters</u></a>.</p>
