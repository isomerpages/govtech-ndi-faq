<h3>How does the additional security verification with Singpass Face Verification work?</h3>
<p>Singpass Face Verification (SFV) is a method of verifying your identity
using a face scan compared against the government's records.</p>
<p>Singpass may require you to perform an additional security verification
using SFV in some situations, such as when setting up your Singpass app
or when for your protection, Singpass needs to confirm it is you logging
in. This is an additional safeguard against unauthorised access to your
Singpass account or services that require Singpass login.</p>
