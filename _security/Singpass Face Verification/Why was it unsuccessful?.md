<h3>Why is my Singpass Face Verification unsuccessful?</h3>
<p>There may be several possible reasons for this. For ways to improve the
success of Face Verification, you should ensure that:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your face is not covered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You keep still while scanning is in progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your environment is not too dark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no strong lighting in the background</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use a minimum resolution of 2 megapixels for the camera</p>
</li>
</ol>
