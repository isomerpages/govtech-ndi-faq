<h3>I have received an SMS OTP from Singpass, but I did not request for it. What do I do?</h3>
<p>There is a chance that someone has your Singpass ID and password, and
is trying to log into your account. However, with Singpass 2FA, your account
is protected. The hacker needs to have your mobile phone to perform transactions
involving sensitive data.
<br>
<br>Nonetheless, we strongly advise you to take the following actions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reset your Singpass password immediately to prevent unauthorised access
to your account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call Singpass Helpdesk at <a href="tel:+6563353533" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">+65 6335 3533</a> and press “9” for 24-hour scam
support to secure your account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lodge a police report at any Neighbourhood Centre/Post, or via the <a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Electronic Police Centre website</u></a>.</p>
