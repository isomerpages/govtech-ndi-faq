<h3>Singpass 2FA</h3>
<p>Singpass Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) helps to better protect your
personal data. There are two steps in this security process.</p>
<h4>If you are logging in to a digital service with your Singpass app:</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Scan the QR code on the login page using your Singpass app QR code scanner,
if you are logging in from your desktop. Tap (touch and release) on the
QR code, if you are logging in on a mobile device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your fingerprint (for selected smartphones), face (for selected smartphones)
or enter your 6-digit passcode in the Singpass app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>If you are logging in to a digital service with your Singpass ID and password:</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enter your Singpass ID and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Face Verification to complete your 2FA, or enter a One-Time Password
sent via SMS</p>
