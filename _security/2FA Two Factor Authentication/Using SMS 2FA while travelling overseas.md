<h3>I am travelling overseas and will be using a Singapore mobile number. Can I still use my Singpass SMS 2FA?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you are using your Singapore-registered mobile number overseas,
you should be able to use SMS 2FA and receive notifications.

<br><strong>Note:</strong> There may be a lag time in receiving One-Time Passwords
via SMS.</p>
