<h3>Without the need to enter my Singpass ID and password, is Singpass app considered to be only one-factor authentication?</h3>
<p>Singpass app is a mode of two-factor authentication (2FA). It involves:
<br>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The app that is in your mobile phone (what you have), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your biometrics (what you are) such as fingerprint or face, or 6-digit
passcode (what you know)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<br>To protect your account, please be reminded to only register your own
fingerprint (for selected smartphones), or face (for selected smartphones)
on your smartphone, and not to share your 6-digit passcode with other individuals.
<br>
<br>There are also several layers of security measures in place. For example,
when the app detects potential security breach or presence of malicious
software on your mobile device, it will not allow you to use the app on
that device.</p>
