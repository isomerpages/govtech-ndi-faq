<h3>I do not own a mobile phone. What are the alternatives to the OneKey token?</h3>
<p>From 1 April 2021, if you need to perform logins and transactions that

SMS 2FA or Face Verification.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to visit any of the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass counters</u></a> islandwide
or the respective agencies to perform your transactions over the counter.
You may contact the respective agencies to enquire.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>I do not own a smartphone, and thus am unable to use Singpass app. What are the alternatives to the OneKey token?</h3>
<p>You may access services using Singpass SMS 2FA and Face Verification.
<br>
<br>For SMS 2FA, all you need to do is enter your Singpass ID and password,
followed by a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS to your mobile number.
If you have not set up SMS 2FA, please follow the <a href="http://www.go.gov.sg/singpass-guides" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>instructional guide</u></a> to
register for your SMS 2FA.
<br>
<br><strong>For Face Verification, simply log in to any government digital service with your Singpass ID and password. </strong>Select
Face Verification at the next step and follow the instructions on your
screen to scan your face. This service works on a computer that is equipped
with a web camera.</p>
