<h3>Will Singpass app have access to all my personal files in my phone?</h3>
<p>The Singpass app requires your "Device ID" to tie your device to your
Singpass account as part of the verification process during logins. It
is a common requirement for apps to request for certain permissions so
as to facilitate transactions. Please be assured that the app does not
access, read or store any of your personal files.</p>
