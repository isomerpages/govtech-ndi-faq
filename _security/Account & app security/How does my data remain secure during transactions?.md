<h3>How can I be sure that my personal data remains secure during the transaction?</h3>
<p>We have stringent security measures in place to safeguard your personal
data. For example, when you use Singpass app to scan the QR code at the
counter, the app will check for the legitimacy of the QR code before requesting
for your consent to share the required data with the organisation/government
agency. The data will be encrypted and sent securely to the organisation/government
agency.</p>
