<h3>What is strong versus weak biometrics?</h3>
<p>Android tests the biometric implementation of mobile devices and classifies
them as “Strong”, “Weak” or “Convenience” depending on how well they can
guard against spoofing attempts (e.g. unlocking a user’s phone using a
recorded sample). Read more about Android’s biometric security classification
