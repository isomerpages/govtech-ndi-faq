<h3>What precaution should I take if I want to use fingerprint authentication / face recognition for my Singpass app?</h3>
<p>Your Singpass account contains sensitive personal information, and is
intended as a means of verification and authentication of your identity
online.</p>
<p>When using Singpass app, you are reminded to only register your own fingerprint
or face on your smartphone, and not to share your 6-digit passcode with
other individuals.</p>
<p>This is to maintain the confidentiality, safekeeping and security of your
Singpass account and the transactions conducted through it.</p>
