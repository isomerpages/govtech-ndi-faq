<h3>Is it compulsory for me to use Multi-User SMS 2FA? Can I continue to use existing methods?</h3>
<p>It is not compulsory to use Multi-User SMS 2FA. We encourage users to
first explore other existing 2FA methods such as Singpass app, SMS One-Time
Password (SMS-OTP), or Face Verification. However, we also recognise that
some users might find Multi-User SMS 2FA to be a more convenient option.</p>
