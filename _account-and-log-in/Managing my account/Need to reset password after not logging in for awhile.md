<h3>I have not used Singpass for a while. Why do I have to reset my password?</h3>
<p>If you have not logged into your Singpass account for a prolonged period
of time, your account will be listed as dormant. This is part of the security
measures in place to protect users' account and personal data.
<br>
<br>To re-instate your account, simply visit <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-login" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass Portal</u></a> and reset
your Singpass password.</p>
