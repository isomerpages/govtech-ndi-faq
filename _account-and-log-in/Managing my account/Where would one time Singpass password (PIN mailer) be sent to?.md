<h3>Where would my one-time Singpass password (PIN mailer) be sent to?</h3>

with the Government. It will arrive within 3 working days for local address
and 10 working days for overseas address (depending on the overseas postal
services). If you are holding a work pass issued by MOM, the registered
address will be your companyâ€™s address.</p>
