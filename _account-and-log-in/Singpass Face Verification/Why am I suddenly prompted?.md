<h3>I have been logging in to services using Singpass 2FA. Why am I suddenly prompted to perform an additional security verification using Singpass Face Verification for logins?</h3>
<p>Singpass is continuously strengthening its security measures as part of
our efforts to combat evolving scams.</p>
<p>Singpass may require users to perform an additional security verification
using Singpass Face Verification in some situations, such as when setting
up your Singpass app or when for your protection, Singpass needs to confirm
it is you logging in. This is an additional safeguard against unauthorised
access to your Singpass account or services that require Singpass login.</p>
