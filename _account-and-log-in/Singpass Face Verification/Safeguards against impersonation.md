<h3>Will someone who looks a lot like me, or a twin, be able to impersonate me?</h3>
<p>Biometrics will not be used as the sole authentication factor for more
sensitive transactions. This ensures that someone with similar facial features
(e.g. identical twins) will not be able to access your account. Additional
authentication factors (e.g. password, SMS-OTP, Singpass app) may be required
on top of biometrics.</p>
