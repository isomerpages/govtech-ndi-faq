<h3>What should I do if the QR code on my digitally authenticated and endorsed Vaccination HealthCert does not work?</h3>
<p>For security reasons and protection of user data, each instance of a QR
code on the Vaccination HealthCert has a validity period of 14 days and
is automatically refreshed thereafter.</p>
<p>If you face issues with the QR code but the Vaccination HealthCert is
valid/verified, you may try to refresh the certificate using the Refresh
icon on the top right corner when viewing the document. This will retrieve
a new QR code.</p>
<p>If necessary, you may request for the re-issuance of a HealthCert through
the&nbsp;<a href="http://notarise.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotÎ±rise</u></a>.</p>
