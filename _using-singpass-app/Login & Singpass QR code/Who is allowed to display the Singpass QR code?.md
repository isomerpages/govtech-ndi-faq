<h3>Which organisations are allowed to display the Singpass QR code?</h3>
<p>The Government will only issue the Singpass QR code to businesses/government
agencies which have on-boarded Singpass app to verify the identity of their
customers in-person. The Singpass QR code is unique to each business/government
agency, and it can only request for a set of data, pre-approved by the
Government, to be collected for verification purposes.</p>
