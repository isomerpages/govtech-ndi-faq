<h3>I would prefer not to show my Digital IC on my apps homepage. How can I hide it?</h3>
<p>We have implemented an option for users to hide their Digital IC on the
home screen from 30 November 2021. Please update your Singpass app to the
latest version via the app store to enjoy this feature.
<br>
<br>To hide your Digital IC by default (i.e., in the hidden state each time
the home screen is shown):&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap on the Settings menu at the top right corner of the home screen&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toggle on the option Always hide My Cards&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Digital IC will be automatically hidden every time the home screen
is shown
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To disable the hide by default function:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap on the Settings menu at the top right corner of the home screen&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toggle off the option Always hide My Cards&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify your identity with your fingerprint, face or passcode&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Digital IC will no longer be automatically hidden every time the
home screen is shown&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also choose to temporarily hide your Digital IC at any time by
tapping on the up arrow at the My Cards section. In this case, the app
launches the next time in its last saved setting, i.e., the Digital IC
stays hidden if you have chosen to hide it before closing the app, and
vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quickly unhide the Digital IC for a transaction, tap on the down arrow
and authenticate with your fingerprint, face or passcode. Upon authentication,
you will be able to access full details of your Digital IC. You will only
be prompted to re-authenticate after 2 minutes.</p>
