<h3>My photo in my Singpass app Digital IC is not the latest. Why is this so?</h3>
<p>If you have recently renewed your NRIC / passport / work pass with the
Ministry of Manpower (MOM) / Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA),
you may not see your updated photo on your Digital IC immediately. Processing
time is required for the updated photo to be reflected in your Singpass
app.</p>
