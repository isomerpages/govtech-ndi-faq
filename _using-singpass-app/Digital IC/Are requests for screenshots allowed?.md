<h3>An organisation has requested for a screenshot of my Singpass Digital IC. Is this allowed?</h3>
<p>The Singpass Digital IC is an alternative for a user to present his identity
credentials for in-person services, but it is not meant to be screen captured
for record keeping due to security reasons.
<br>
<br>If personal data needs to be collected, agencies or businesses should
use the Singpass Verify or Myinfo services to retrieve the data with the
users consent. Alternatively, agencies or businesses may record the information
displayed on the Digital IC into their own systems. The collection and
use of data are subject to Public Sector (Governance) Act or Personal Data
Protection Act where applicable.</p>
