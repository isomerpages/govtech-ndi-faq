<p>Myinfo is a service that allows Singpass users to manage their personal
data and pre-fill forms, with their consent, in digital services transactions.
This includes data that is retrieved across participating Government agencies.</p>
<p>This means that users need only provide personal data once to the digital
service, instead of repeatedly providing data for every online transaction.
Users can view their own personal data profile on their Singpass app under
Profile.</p>
