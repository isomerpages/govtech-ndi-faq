<h3>What is a signing certificate?</h3>
<p>You may request for a signing certificate from the National Certification
Authority (NCA) for the purposes of digitally signing agreements or authorising
transactions. This certificate cryptographically binds your identity to
information that will be used to verify your digital signature. The signing
certificate contains information that is a means of identifying you to
the digital service.</p>
