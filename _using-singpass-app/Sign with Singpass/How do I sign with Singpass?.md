<h3>How do I sign with Singpass?</h3>
<p>To digitally sign documents with your Singpass app, follow these steps:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use the ‘Scan’ feature on the app homepage to scan the Singpass QR code*
on the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Match the reference code displayed on your app screen with that on the
document. This ensures you are signing the correct document.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authenticate using your fingerprint, face recognition or 6-digit passcode.
You have now successfully signed the document.</p>
</li>
</ol>
