<h3>What is your Profile in the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>The integration of Myinfo in the Singpass app lets you view your data
from Government sources, such as passport/drivers licence expiry date,
CPF contribution history and HDB property information, directly in the
app.
<br>
<br>To view your Profile, simply follow these steps:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Launch Singpass app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the relevant Profile category</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify your identity using your fingerprint (for selected smartphones),
face (for selected smartphones) or 6-digit passcode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your data from government sources will be displayed with sensitive data
masked for privacy purposes. Tap on the 'eye' icon on the top right to
unmask details</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<br>To customise the data displayed, tap on "View all" on the homepage, followed
by the setting menu (three dots on the top right) and select "Show/hide
categories".
<br>
<br>For security, Singpass requires you to authenticate and verify your identity
to access personal data. A grace period of 2 minutes is provided for you
to switch between different profile categories before you are prompted
to authenticate again.</p>
