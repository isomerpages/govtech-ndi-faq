<h3>Why is there no logout button on the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>The Singpass app is built to ensure high levels of security, such as requiring
the user to perform identity verification using fingerprint, face or 6-digit
passcode when accessing services or personal information. If malicious
apps or altered settings that may compromise the security of the device
is detected, the Singpass app will not be usable until the threat has been
neutralised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We advise all users to password protect their device and set up their
own biometric data for secure access. Should you misplace your device,
you may choose to deactivate the Singpass app quickly on the Singpass website
or install the app on another device to automatically deactivate it on
the lost device.</p>
