<h3>What information would business users be able to view in the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>Users can view corporate data retrieved from participating government
agencies via the Myinfo business service, such as business registration,
shareholder, capital, and appointment holder details. The full list of
data items can be found <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/myinfobusiness/data-items" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> (grants
and licenses information are presently not available).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>These data items are official records that businesses have registered
with the Government, retrieved from verified government sources (e.g.,
ACRA, BCA).</p>
