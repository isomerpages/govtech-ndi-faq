<h3>How can business users access My Corporate Profile within the Singpass app?</h3>
<p>Users are first required to link their Corppass account(s) to the Singpass
app. The steps to do so are as follows:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap on the <strong>Settings</strong> menu (gear icon) on the Singpass app
homepage&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select ‘<strong>Link Corporate Accounts</strong>’ and tap ‘<strong>Next</strong>’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify your identity</strong> with your fingerprint, face, or 6-digit
passcode. Upon successful authentication, the app will retrieve and link
your valid Corppass account(s).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After linking your Corppass account(s), you would then be able to switch
to your preferred account(s) seamlessly and securely. The steps are as
follows:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap on ‘<strong>Switch Account</strong>’ on the Singpass app homepage&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify your identity</strong> with your fingerprint, face, or 6-digit
passcode&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Select your preferred Corppass account</strong> and view its corporate
data from the My Corporate Profile section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to use this feature but do not have a valid Corppass
account, please approach your business entity’s Corppass Administrator
for assistance. Alternatively, if you have been nominated as a Corppass
Administrator by your entity's Registered Officer (RO), you may click
<a href="https://www.corppass.gov.sg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u> 
</a>to register for a Corppass Administrator account.</p>
