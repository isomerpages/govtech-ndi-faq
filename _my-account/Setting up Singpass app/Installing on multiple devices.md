<h4>Can I install the Singpass app on multiple devices?</h4>
<p>Singpass app can only be installed on one mobile device at a time. Activating
Singpass app on a new device will automatically deactivate the app on your
previous device, ensuring that there is only one copy of your credentials.
This grants a tighter level of security control and remains convenient
for most Singpass users.</p>
