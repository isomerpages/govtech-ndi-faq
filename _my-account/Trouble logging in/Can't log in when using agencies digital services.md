<p><strong>I cannot log into my Singpass account when using agencies digital services. What do I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Please check that you have entered your Singpass ID and password correctly.</p>
<p>If your details are correct, try again after 5 minutes, as the mobile
network may be congested.</p>
<p>Should the issue persist, please contact the agency (in-charge of that
digital service) directly for assistance.</p>
