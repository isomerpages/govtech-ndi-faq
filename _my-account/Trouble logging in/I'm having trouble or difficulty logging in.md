<h4>I cannot log into my Singpass account when using agencies digital services. What do I do?</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Please check that you have entered your Singpass ID and password correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your details are correct, try again after 5 minutes, as the mobile
network may be congested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the issue persist, please contact the agency (in-charge of that
digital service) directly for assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h4>I can't seem to log in to certain digital services using Singpass app despite having set it up. Why is this so?</h4>
<p>When logging in through a web browser, check that your browser allows
Singpass app to automatically launch when you tap on the QR code.</p>
<p><strong>For Android users</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Go to "Settings" &gt; "Apps" &gt; select "Singpass app" &gt; "Set as default".
Under the "App Links" section, choose "In this app" under "Go to supported
URLs".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For best experience, please use Google Chrome as your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For iOS users</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap and hold on the QR code on the Singpass login page, then select "Open
in Singpass app". If this option isn't available, please wait for an hour
before trying again or reinstall the app thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For best experience, please use Safari as your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also use Singpass app to log in to some Government apps. More
Government apps will come on board Singpass app progressively.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>What should I do if I face difficulty logging into a government mobile app with Singpass?</h4>
<p><strong>Here are some ways you can troubleshoot:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your device operating system and app are updated to the latest
version</p>

<p>Check that your device date-time setting is set to “Automatic”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you did not block all cookies in your browser settings</p>
