<h3>I can't seem to log in to certain digital services using Singpass app despite having set it up. Why is this so?</h3>
<p>When logging in through a web browser, check that your browser allows
Singpass app to automatically launch when you tap on the QR code.</p>
<h4>For Android users</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Go to "Settings" &gt; "Apps" &gt; select "Singpass app" &gt; "Set as default".
Under the "App Links" section, choose "In this app" under "Go to supported
URLs".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For best experience, please use Google Chrome as your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>For iOS users</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tap and hold on the QR code on the Singpass login page, then select "Open
in Singpass app". If this option isn't available, please wait for an hour
before trying again or reinstall the app thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For best experience, please use Safari as your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>You may also use Singpass app to log in to some Government apps. More
Government apps will come on board Singpass app progressively.</p>
