<h4>After I scan the QR code on the login page, my app launches and there is a message stating that “this request has expired”. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Please ensure that your device is set to update the date and time automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For Android devices, go to your phone settings, select "Date &amp; Time",
followed by "Set Automatically".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For iOS devices, this is under "Settings" &gt; "General" &gt; "Date &amp;
Time".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact steps may differ depending on your device. Once done, you may
try logging in using the app again.</p>
