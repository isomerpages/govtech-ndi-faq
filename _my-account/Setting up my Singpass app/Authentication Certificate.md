<h3>What is an authentication certificate?</h3>
<p>Upon downloading and setting up the Singpass app on your device, you will
be issued a digital identity by the National Certification Authority (NCA).
This is used as proof of your online identity whenever you transact with
Singpass.
<br>
<br>Your digital identity is represented by the authentication certificate
issued to you. It comes with a unique serial number that can be seen in
your Singpass app settings (under "Your digital identity details").</p>
