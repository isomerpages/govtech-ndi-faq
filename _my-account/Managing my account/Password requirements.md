<h3>What are the password requirements?</h3>
<p>Having a strong password is essential to keeping your Singpass account
safe.</p>
<h4>Your Singpass password should meet the following criteria:</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consist of 8 to 24 alphanumeric characters, with at least 1 letter and
1 number. It should preferably contain capital letters and symbols. Special
characters, excluding space, can be used (e.g. hgu%7$)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot be the same as any of the past five passwords used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot be the same as your Singpass ID, or contain the numeric values
of your NRIC / FIN and the word "pass" or "pwd" (e.g. 12345Pwd, Password1,
pass1234, S1234567)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>You are advised not to use a password that can be easily guessed, such
as your contact number, date of birth, identity card number or family member's
name.</p>
