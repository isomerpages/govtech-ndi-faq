<h3>I have lost my mobile device. What should I do?</h3>
<p><u>Option 1</u> 
<br>As an immediate measure to safeguard personal data, you should log in
to your Singpass account at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-login" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass Portal</u></a> &gt;
Select <strong>My Account </strong>&gt; Select <strong>Manage 2FA</strong> &gt;
Select <strong>Deactivate</strong> to deactivate your Singpass app.
<br>
<br><u>Option 2</u> 
<br>You can install the Singpass app on a new mobile device. Once you have
activated the Singpass app on your new device, the Singpass app on your
lost device will be automatically deactivated to ensure security.
<br>
<br><u>Option 3</u> 
<br>You may also choose to visit any of the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass counters</u></a> in
person, with your original NRIC or FIN card, to deactivate your Singpass
app on the lost device.</p>
