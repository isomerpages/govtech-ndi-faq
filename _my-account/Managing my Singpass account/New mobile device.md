<h3>I got a new mobile device. What should I do to use the app on this new device?</h3>
<p>You should download and set up the Singpass app on your new device. Once
you have activated Singpass app on your new device, the Singpass app on
your previous mobile device will automatically be deactivated to ensure
security. There is no need to uninstall the app from previous devices.</p>
