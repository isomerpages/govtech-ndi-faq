<h3>What should I do if I change my mobile phone number?</h3>
<p>Primary users of the mobile number need to update this information with
Singpass proactively. Otherwise, the SMS-OTP will continue to be sent to
the old number.
<br>
<br>After the primary user has updated his mobile number with Singpass, the
secondary users SMS-OTP will automatically be sent to the primary users
new mobile number. There is no need for the secondary user to update Singpass
separately.</p>
<h4>To update your mobile number:</h4>
