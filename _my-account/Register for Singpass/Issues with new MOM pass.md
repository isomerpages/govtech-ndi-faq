<h4>I have just obtained a new pass issued by MOM. I used it to apply for Singpass, but encountered the error message 'You have entered an invalid Name/ Singpass ID/ Date of Issue'. Why is this so?</h4>
<p>Your new records with MOM may take some time to be updated in the Singpass
system. Please try again after 24 hours.</p>
