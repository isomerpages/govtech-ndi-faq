<h4>Why do I have to perform a one-time account update upon logging in?</h4>
<p>This is to better protect your Singpass account. You need to provide and
verify your personal details, and select your preferred mode of contact
(email or mobile number) to receive prompt notifications when there are
changes made to your account details.
<br>
<br>By registering your mobile number during the one-time account update,
you will be instantly activated for SMS 2FA. Click <a href="https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/SINGPASS/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx#FAQ_1112343" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> to
find out more about setting up SMS 2FA.</p>
