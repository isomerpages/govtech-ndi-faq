<p><em>I received an error message saying that the mobile number I provided is already registered and cannot be used for Singpass with my account. What should I do?</em>
</p>
<p>Unless with your explicit consent in the case of the Multi-User SMS 2FA,
only one mobile number can be registered to one Singpass account at any
time for security reasons. The error message indicates that your number
may have been registered by another user.
<br>
<br>If you want to use this mobile number for your Singpass account, please

further assistance.</p>
