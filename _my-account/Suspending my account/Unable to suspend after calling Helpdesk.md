<h3>After calling the Singpass Helpdesk, I am unable to get through the first step to suspend my account. Why is this so?</h3>
<p>Please ensure that you are using a Singapore registered mobile number
for this call. In addition, if you have exceeded the maximum number of
tries per day, you will not be able to proceed.</p>
