<h3>What is Multi-User SMS 2FA?</h3>
<p><strong>Family or trusted care support</strong>
</p>
<p>We recognise that there might be a group of users without personal mobile
smartphones and/or computers. These users may rely on a trusted family
member or caregiver to help transact digitally with the Government.
<br>
<br>As such, this feature was created to allow users to link their account
to another persons mobile number for the sole purpose of the latter receiving
SMS One-Time Passwords (OTP) on behalf of the former. The primary user
of the mobile number will receive the secondary users SMS-OTP as a Two-Factor
Authentication (2FA) when the secondary user is making transactions that
involve more sensitive data.
<br>
<br>Primary users will not be able to see what the secondary user is transacting
on nor receive any government-linked mailers or notifications on behalf
of the secondary user.</p>
<h3>What type of services can I expect with Multi-User SMS 2FA?</h3>
<p>This feature is offered as an alternative Two-Factor Authentication for
citizens to transact using their Singpass account. It provides access to
any government digital services and services of industry partners which
require Singpass login.</p>
