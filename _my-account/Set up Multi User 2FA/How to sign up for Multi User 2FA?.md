<h3>How can I sign up for the Multi-User SMS 2FA service?</h3>
<p>Both the primary and secondary users of the mobile number are required
to present their NRIC/FIN to verify their identities and consent to the
terms of the arrangement at any of the <a href="http://go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Singpass counters</u></a> islandwide
to activate this option. A video call can be arranged with the Singpass
Helpdesk for users who are not able to visit our Singpass counters.
<br>
<br>Primary users can link their mobile number with up to six (6) secondary
users. However, as a security feature, the secondary users account can
only be linked to one mobile user at any one time.
<br>
<br>This arrangement of having both parties present to verify their identities
and consent to the terms of the Multi-User SMS 2FA setup is necessary to
safeguard the interest of our users and to avoid any potential misuse.
